# Version 1.0

Basic asteriods game at this point. Each level in manual coded to change after a certain score. Asteriods spawn at constant rate, and the screen will only ever have one asteroid at a time. Single selectable player at the moment, and only one type of weapon. 

# Version 1.1

Big step up from version 1.0. In this new version, special meteors randomly spawn giving special abilities. The 2x meteor falls during a difficult level, and allows the user to shoot two lasers at once. There is a nuke that drops in front of levels where hundreds of meteors spawn at once, and the user has to hit this meteor to survive. When the nuke is hit, all the meteors explode.
